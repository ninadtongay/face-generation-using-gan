# face-generation-using-gan
Applied DCGAN to generate face images

In this project, I have built and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of human faces. The goal of this project is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possble. Check the images at the end of the notebook to see the final results

You can follow the instructions provided in python notebook to execute the model.
